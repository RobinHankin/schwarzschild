# Overview

The `schwarzschild` package creates a series of high-quality PDF images
showing different aspects of the physics of black holes.

# Installation

The package is not yet on CRAN. To install the current development
version use `devtools`:

    R> devtools::install_github("RobinHankin/schwarzschild")

And then to load the package use `library()`:

``` r
library("schwarzschild")
```

All PDF diagrams are created by `inst/maker.R` and a Makefile is
provided.
