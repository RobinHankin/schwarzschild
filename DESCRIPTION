Description:
  Visual display of the physics of Einstein's general
  theory of relativity.  Provides R functionality to illustrate
  Schwarzschild black holes in a range of coordinate systems using
  mathematically accurate plotting routines; also creates animations
  of gravitational waves.  For special relativity, see the 'lorentz'
  package.
Depends: R (>= 3.0),gsl,deSolve,animation,grImport
