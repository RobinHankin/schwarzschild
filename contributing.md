# Contributing to the schwarzschild package

I would love your input! I want to make contributing to this project
as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Implementing new features
- Reporting positive feedback and encouragement from students of GR
- Reporting negative feedback or suggestions for new functionality

I try to [assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith).

##  Develop with Github

I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as
well as accept pull requests.

## I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [Github
Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
Please note that I am not 100% confident about PR etiquette, as I am
still learning github norms.  But, I actively welcome your pull
requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Document the added code as fully as possible
3. Ensure the test suite passes `R CMD check`
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are
understood to be under the same that covers the project.  Feel free to
contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report issues using Github's [issues](https://github.com/RobinHankin/clock/issues)

I am using GitHub issues to track public bugs.  Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Doesn't really matter what style that is, so long as it's internally consistent.
