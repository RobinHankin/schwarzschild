\section{Introduction}

The \pkg{schwarzschild} package creates high-quality PDFs that
illustrate different aspects of physics near a spherically symmetric
black hole.  The software is maintainable and extensively
customisable.  Although the {\em raison d'\^{e}tre} of the package is
the PDF images themselves, the physics underlying the Schwarzschild
black hole is illustrated by the \proglang{R} functionality.

In general relativity, Schwarzschild coordinates for a black hole have
desirable properties such as asymptotic matching with flat-space
spherical coordinates; but other coordinate systems can be used which
have other advantages.  The \pkg{schwarzschild} package furnishes
plots which use a variety of coordinates including Kruskal-Szekeres,
Eddington-Finkelstein ingoing and outgoing, Gullstrand-Painleve,
Lema\^{i}tre, and various Penrose transforms.  These are described in
many undergraduate GR textbooks.  This vignette shows some, but not
all, of the included functionality.  The diagrams use a consistent
colouring system which is user-settable.  For special relativity, see
the \pkg{lorentz} package.

\section{Schwarzschild coordinates}

The Schwarzschild solution describes spacetime in the vicinity of a
black hole.  It was the first known nontrivial solution to the
Einstien field equations and was discovered in 1916 by Karl
Schwarzschild~\citep{schwarzschild1916}.  The full Schwarzschild metric
is

\begin{equation}
  ds^2 = -\left(1-2M/r\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-2M/r} + r^2d\theta^2+ r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2
  \end{equation}

\noindent where geometrized units ($G=c=1$) are used and $M$ is the
mass of the black hole.  Thus coordinate $t$ matches time as measured
by a distant observer, and $r$ has the property that a circle of
radius $r$ has circumference $\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}ds=2\pi r$.

Here we consider only a radial line
corresponding to~$\theta, \phi$ constant, giving

\begin{equation}\label{schwarz_radial}
  ds^2 = -\left(1-2M/r\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-2M/r}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Null geodesics}
Null geodesics, paths for which $ds=0$, follow $dr=\pm(1-2M/r)dt$ (the
positive sign for outgoing light and negative for outgoing light);
integrating, we have

\begin{equation}\label{nullgeodesic}
C\pm t=r+\log\left|r-2M\right|
\end{equation}

where $C$ is a constant of integration; this is implemented in package
idiom by functions \code{ingoing()} and \code{outgoing()}
respectively.

\subsection{Geodesic paths}

Spacelike geodesics for objects in freefall may be determined
similarly.  The general geodesic equation reads

\begin{equation}\label{geodesic}
  \frac{d}{d\tau}\left(g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau}
\end{equation}

where $\tau$ is proper time for an object.  Using the fact that the
Schwarzschild metric~\ref{schwarz_radial} is time-independent and
diagonal, the $\mu=t$ component of equation~\ref{geodesic} for a
radial path simplifies to
$\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(g_{tt}\frac{dt}{d\tau}\right)=0 $, and
substituting $g_{tt}=-(1-2M/r)$ gives us that
$(1-2M/r)\frac{dt}{d\tau}=e$, a constant.  Considering an object at a
distance large compared with $M$ from the black hole allows us to
identify $e$ with the (relativistic) energy per unit mass at infinity.
Recalling that $g_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu=-1$, radial Schwarzschild paths
tell us that $ g_{tt}\left(\frac{dt}{d\tau}\right)^2 +
g_{rr}\left(\frac{dr}{d\tau}\right)^2 = -1 $, and substituting from
the Schwarzschild metric we find that
$1+(dr/d\tau)^2=(1-2M/r)^2(dt/d\tau)^2$; the energy equation gives us

\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{dr}{d\tau}\right)^2=e(1-2M/r)-1
\end{equation}

Elementary calculus then gives us the useful equation

\begin{equation}
\frac{dr}{dt} = (1-2M/r)\sqrt{(1-2M/r)-1/e}
  \end{equation}

and integration gives us

\begin{equation}
\pm t = C+2M\left(
 \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{r}{2M}\right)^\frac{3}{2}
+2\sqrt{\frac{r}{2M}}
+\log\frac{\left|\sqrt{\frac{r}{2M}}-1\right|}{\sqrt{\frac{r}{2M}}+1}
\right)
  \end{equation}

which is implemented in the package as function \code{raindrop()}. 

\section{Package graphics: Schwarzschild coordinates}

Null- and spacelike geodesics may be plotted in any coordinate system;
in this section we use Schwarzschild coordinates in which the unit of
distance and of time is the Schwarzschild radius~$2M$.
Figure~\ref{schwarzschild} shows ingoing and outgoing null geodesics
according to equation~\ref{nullgeodesic}.  This figure contains a
wealth of physical insight, made clearer by the fact that it is
mathematically precise.  For example, ingoing null geodesics do not
cross the event horizon, which might be interpreted as saying that
nothing passes the event horizon (see also
figure~\ref{schwarzschild_drops} which demonstrates that ingoing
massive particles do not cross the event horizon).  Ingoing and
outgoing null geodesics are marked with arrows which show the
direction of travel of a light path.  Observe how ingoing light
travels backward in Schwarzschild time inside the event horizon; and
note how the angle subtended by the inward and outward light
approaches zero at the singularity.

Further, see how the light cones (gray) morph discontinuously as the
event horizon is crossed.  This pathology is not physical: it is
purely a manifestation of the coordinate singularity at $r=2M$ and it
is possible to use other coordinate systems, shown below, that do not
exhibit this phenomenon.

Worldlines of freely falling objects may be calculated and plotted on
Schwarzschild coordinates (figure~\ref{schwarzschild_throw}) or
logarithmic Schwarzschild coordinates
(figure~\ref{schwarzschild_throw_logx}).  See how outward-directed
objects on the interior of the black hole travel backward in
Schwarzschild time, as for null geodesics.  Also see how all world
lines, whether inward or outward directed, have zero slope as the
singularity is approached.

\section{Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates}

Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates use the same radial coordinate as
Schwarzschild diagrams above but replace $t$ with
$t'=t+r+2M\left|\frac{r}{2M}-1\right|$.  In this system, ingoing
null geodesics have a slope $45^\circ$ and pass through the event
horizon and outgoing null geodesics do not cross the event horizon;
see figure~\ref{eddington}.  See how neither light cones nor ingoing
null geodesics suffer any rupture as the event horizon is crossed;
however, the light cones tip over as the event horizon is approached
and inside the Schwarzschild radius the light cone points entirely
inwards.  Note however that the angle subtended by the inward and
outward paths approaches zero at the singularity.

It is possible to use $t'=t-r-2M\left|\frac{r}{2M}-1\right|$
instead, and this has the effect of forcing outgoing null geodesics to
have a slope of $45^\circ$ (figure~\ref{eddingtonoutgoing}).  In this
case ingoing light becomes tangential to the event horizon close to
the event horizon.

  Schwarzschild time (orange) cross the event horizon.  As the
  singularity is approached, light cones (grey) tip over and at the
  singularity are closed.  Ingoing and outgoing light meet the
  singularity at $45^\circ$ (compare Schwarzschild coordinates where
  the angle is $0^\circ$)}

  but ingoing light (red) does not cross the event horizon}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\clearpage
\section{Gullstrand-Painleve coordinates}

Gullstrand-Painleve coordinates introduce a time coordinate $t_r$ with

\begin{equation}
t_r = t - 2M\left(-\sqrt{\frac{2r}{M}} + \log\left(\frac{\sqrt{\frac{r}{2M}}+1}{\sqrt{\frac{r}{2M}}-1}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
                    
In this coordinate system, the ingoing coordinates are such that the
time coordinate is (up to a constant) the proper time of a
free-falling observer who starts from far away at zero velocity; see
figures~\ref{gullstrand_painleve} and~\ref{gullstrand_painleve_drops}.
The metric tensor becomes: 

\begin{equation}
ds^2=\left(1-\frac{2M}{r} \right)dt_r^2- 2\sqrt{\frac{2M}{r}} dr dt_r -dr^2.
\end{equation}

Note that this is not diagonal, and this complicates matters although
null geodesics may be found by factorising the metric.  Similarly to
Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, ingoing null geodesics pass through
the event horizon unimpeded while outgoing null geodesics are
tangential.  World lines for freely falling raindrops are shown in
figure \ref{gullstrand_painleve_drops}.  Again we see that, in these
coordinates, infalling raindrops pass through the event horizon.

\section{Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates}

\begin{eqnarray}
T &=& \left(\frac{r}{2M} - 1\right)^{1/2}e^{r/4M}\sinh\left(\frac{t}{4M}\right)\\
X &=& \left(\frac{r}{2M} - 1\right)^{1/2}e^{r/4M}\cosh\left(\frac{t}{4M}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
for the exterior region $r>2M$ outside the event horizon and:
\begin{eqnarray}
T &=& \left(1 - \frac{r}{2M}\right)^{1/2}e^{r/4M}\cosh\left(\frac{t}{4M}\right)\\
X &=& \left(1 - \frac{r}{2M}\right)^{1/2}e^{r/4M}\sinh\left(\frac{t}{4M}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

for the interior region $0<r<2M$; see figure~\ref{kruskal_szekeres}.
In this representation, the singularity appears as a black hyperbola
and the event horizon is a set of $45^\circ$ lines.  Ingoing and
outgoing null geodesics are lines at $45^\circ$, which shows that
objects inside the black hole cannot escape (that is, events below the
singularity and above the pink event horizon) cannot escape.  This
diagram also includes lines of constant Schwarzschild $r$ and $t$,
showing that inside the event horizon, $r$ is a timelike coordinate
and $t$ a spacelike coordinate.

Figure~\ref{kruskal_szekeres_throw} also shows worldlines of some
moving objects, and figure~\ref{kruskal_szekeres_extended} shows
extended coordinate system in which the antiuniverse and white hole
are visible.  The possibility of causal connection between universe
and antiuniverse is indicated by the crossing of ingoing null
geodesics from the universe intersecting with outgoing (?) null
geodesics from the antiuniverse.

  left and a white hole below the black hole.  The only way that
  objects in the universe can have a causal link with objects in the
  antiuniverse is via the interior of the black hole and examples of
  intersecting null geodesics are shown.  The white hole is a region
  from which escape is inevitable}

\subsection{Inverted Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates}

It is possible to plot contour lines of equal $X,T$ on Schwarzschild
coordinates, figure~\ref{kruskal_szekeres_inverted}.

  (blue) and $T$ (brown), neither of which cross the event horizon}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\section{Lema\^{i}tre coordinates}

Lema\^{i}tre coordinates are another way of removing the coordinate
singularity at the event horizon.  The relationship between
Lema\^{i}tre coordinates $\tau,\rho$ and Schwarzschild $r,t$ is most
easily expressed in differential form:

\begin{eqnarray}
d\tau &=& dt +\sqrt{\frac{2M}{r}}\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{-1}\\
d\rho &=& dt +\sqrt{\frac{r}{2M}}\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{-1}\\
\end{eqnarray}

Freely falling particles at rest at infinity follow trajectories with
constant $\rho$, with $\tau$ measuring their proper time.  Lines of
constant $\rho$ are It can be shown that
$r^3=2M\left[3(\rho-\tau)/2\right]^2$; the metric becomes
\begin{equation}
  dx^2= -d\tau^2 + \frac{2M}{r}d\rho^2
  \end{equation}

So null geodesics obey 

\[
\frac{d\tau}{dr}=\frac{1}{\pm 1-\sqrt{2M/r}}
\]

and these are shown in figure~\ref{lemaitre}.

  not.  The singularity is represented as a $45^\circ$ black line, the
  gray above being meaningless.  The event horizon (fuschia) and the
  fact that interior null geodesics have a slope $>45^\circ$ show that
  interior light cannot escape to infinity.  Infalling raindrops, with
  zero speed at infinity, are shown as vertical dotted lines}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\section{Penrose diagrams}

Penrose diagrams are a way of describing the entire universe (reduced
to one spatial dimension plus time) in a compact region.  The usual
transformation law is

\begin{equation}
\tan\left(u\pm v\right)=x\pm t\qquad\longleftrightarrow\qquad u\pm v=\arctan\left(x\pm t\right)
\end{equation}

and we observe that $\arctan(\cdot)$ maps the real line to the
interval~$\left(-\pi,\pi\right)$.  However, it is more convenient to
consider maps from the real line to the unit interval $(0,1)$ and in
this case we would have

\begin{equation}
u\pm v=\frac{1}{2} +\frac{\arctan\left(x\pm t\right)}{\pi}
\end{equation}

and we recognise that~$\frac{1}{2}
+\frac{\arctan\left(\cdot\right)}{\pi}$ is the cumulative distribution
function of a Cauchy random variable.  This gives a diagram as shown
in figure~\ref{penrose_cauchy}.  However, the image is visually
displeasing and it aesthetically preferable to replace the Cauchy with
a logistic or Gaussian transform (figures~\ref{penrose_logistic}
and~\ref{penrose_norm}) which are more commonly used.

\section{Penrose diagrams with black holes}

Similar techniques can be used to present the spacetime surrounding
black holes, although in this case only the Cauchy transform produces
pleasing output (figure~\ref{penrose_BH_cauchy}).  The {\tt
  schwarzschild} package can produce these diagrams for Laplace,
logistic, and Gaussian transforms, but in each of these three cases
the singularity has an ugly and uninformative shape).

In the case of the Cauchy transformation it is possible to extend the
diagram conformally and include---in addition to the universe and the
black hole---the antiuniverse and a white hole, shown in
figure~\ref{penrose_BH_cauchy}.

  labelled, separated by event horizons (fuschia).  Rightward (blue)
  and leftward (red) light appears in all four regions as $45^\circ$
  lines.  See how leftward light originating from the universe can
  interact with rightward light originating from the antiuniverse in
  the black hole, but no timelike path connects the universe with the

\section{Conclusions}

The {\tt schwarzschild} R package makes publication-quality PDF
diagrams of black holes available under an open-source license.  These
diagrams are mathematically accurate which makes them suitable for
educational purposes.  The source code for producing the diagrams
includes inline documentation linking the graphics with the physics;
it is freely available under the General Public License.

A variety of coordinate transforms of Schwarzschild spacetime may be
displayed, including Schwarzschild coordinates, Eddington coordinates,
Lema\^{i}tre coordinates, Gullstrand coordinates, and a number of
Penrose transforms.  Further work might include illustration of the
Kerr or Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metrics.
